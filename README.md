# Topological_Connectivity_Analysis
## Main Objective of the Paper
The main objective of the paper is to prove the closeness and similarity between the graph structures and properties of Rail Network Topology and Optical Cable Network Topology and also provide a mathematical tool that can be a better indicator of connectivity which comes out to be the Graph Spectrum.
## Softwares and Languages used 
1) Online Tool to get the Adjacency Matrix of the given graph : https://graphonline.ru/en/
2) Python IDE : To run the python file that calculates the graph metrics and also genrates the charts of the spectrum
